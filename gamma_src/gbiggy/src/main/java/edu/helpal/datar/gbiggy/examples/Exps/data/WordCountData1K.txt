THE

FILES

BY

TWAIN
(SAMUEL
CLEMENS)



PG
EDITOR'S
NOTE:
This
is
a
compilation
of
all
the
works
of
Mark
Twain
in
the
Project
Gutenberg
Mark
Twain
collection
which
now
has
over
sixty
files.
These
individual
files
have
been
prepared
by
many
different
Gutenberg
volunteers
over
a
period
of
many
years.
Any
of
the
individual
works
may
be
found
in
much
smaller
size
than
this
"entire"
file
at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/

As
additional
works
of
Mark
Twain
become
available
the
present
file
will
be
updated
to
include
them.
The
bibliography
of
Twain
by
Albert
Bigelow
Paine
has
been
used
in
organizing
the
major
works
in
this
collection
in
the
order
of
the
date
of
their
first
publication;
however
many
of
the
short
stories,
speeches
and
other
shorter
works
are
not
in
chronologic
order
as
they
were
originally
included
as
part
of
major
works
of
much
different
publishing
date.
