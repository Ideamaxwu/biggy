PG
EDITOR'S
NOTE:
This
is
a
compilation
of
all
the
works
of
Mark
Twain
in
the
Project
Gutenberg
Mark
Twain
collection
which
now
has
over
sixty
files.
These
individual
files
have
been
prepared
by
many
different
Gutenberg
volunteers
over
a
period
of
many
years.
Any
of
the
individual
works
may
be
found
in
much
smaller
size
than
this
"entire"
file
at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/

As
additional
works
of
Mark
Twain
become
available
the
present
file
will
be
updated
to
include
them.
The
bibliography
of
Twain
by
Albert
Bigelow
Paine
has
been
used
in
organizing
the
major
works
in
this
collection
in
the
order
of
the
date
of
their
first
publication;
however
many
of
the
short
stories,
speeches
and
other
shorter
works
are
not
in
chronologic
order
as
they
were
originally
included
as
part
of
major
works
of
much
different
publishing
date.

PREFACE

This
book
is
a
record
of
a
pleasure
trip.
If
it
were
a
record
of
a
solemn
scientific
expedition,
it
would
have
about
it
that
gravity,
that
profundity,
and
that
impressive
incomprehensibility
which
are
so
proper
to
works
of
that
kind,
and
withal
so
attractive.
Yet
notwithstanding
it
is
only
a
record
of
a
pic-nic,
it
has
a
purpose,
which
is
to
suggest
to
the
reader
how
he
would
be
likely
to
see
Europe
and
the
East
if
he
looked
at
them
with
his
own
eyes
instead
of
the
eyes
of
those
who
traveled
in
those
countries
before
him.
I
make
small
pretense
of
showing
anyone
how
he
ought
to
look
at
objects
of
interest
beyond
the
sea--other
books
do
that,
and
therefore,
even
if
I
were
competent
to
do
it,
there
is
no
need.

I
offer
no
apologies
for
any
departures
from
the
usual
style
of
travel-writing
that
may
be
charged
against
me--for
I
think
I
have
seen
with
impartial
eyes,
and
I
am
sure
I
have
written
at
least
honestly,
whether
wisely
or
not.

In
this
volume
I
have
used
portions
of
letters
which
I
wrote
for
the
Daily
Alta
California,
of
San
Francisco,
the
proprietors
of
that
journal
having
waived
their
rights
and
given
me
the
necessary
permission.
I
have
also
inserted
portions
of
several
letters
written
for
the
New
York
Tribune
and
the
New
York
Herald.

THE
AUTHOR.
SAN
FRANCISCO.





CHAPTER
I.

For
months
the
great
pleasure
excursion
to
Europe
and
the
Holy
Land
was
chatted
about
in
the
newspapers
everywhere
in
America
and
discussed
at
countless
firesides.
It
was
a
novelty
in
the
way
of
excursions--its
like
had
not
been
thought
of
before,
and
it
compelled
that
interest
which
attractive
novelties
always
command.
It
was
to
be
a
picnic
on
a
gigantic
scale.
The
participants
in
it,
instead
of
freighting
an
ungainly
steam
ferry--boat
with
youth
and
beauty
and
pies
and
doughnuts,
and
paddling
up
some
obscure
creek
to
disembark
upon
a
grassy
lawn
and
wear
themselves
out
with
a
long
summer
day's
laborious
frolicking
under
the
impression
that
it
was
fun,
were
to
sail
away
in
a
great
steamship
with
flags
flying
and
cannon
pealing,
and
take
a
royal
holiday
beyond
the
broad
ocean
in
many
a
strange
clime
and
in
many
a
land
renowned
in
history!
They
were
to
sail
for
months
over
the
breezy
Atlantic
and
the
sunny
Mediterranean;
they
were
to
scamper
about
the
decks
by
day,
filling
the
ship
with
shouts
and
laughter--or
read
novels
and
poetry
in
the
shade
of
the
smokestacks,
or
watch
for
the
jelly-fish
and
the
nautilus
over
the
side,
and
the
shark,
the
whale,
and
other
strange
monsters
of
the
deep;
and
at
night
they
were
to
dance
in
the
open
air,
on
the
upper
deck,
in
the
midst
of
a
ballroom
that
stretched
from
horizon
to
horizon,
and
was
domed
by
the
bending
heavens
and
lighted
by
no
meaner
lamps
than
the
stars
and
the
magnificent
moon--dance,
and
promenade,
and
smoke,
and
sing,
and
make
love,
and
search
the
skies
for
constellations
that
never
associate
with
the
"Big
Dipper"
they
were
so
tired
of;
and
they
were
to
see
the
ships
of
twenty
navies--the
customs
and
costumes
of
twenty
curious
peoples--the
great
cities
of
half
a
world--they
were
to
hob-nob
with
nobility
and
hold
friendly
converse
with
kings
and
princes,
grand
moguls,
and
the
anointed
lords
of
mighty
empires!
It
was
a
brave
conception;
it
was
the
offspring
of
a
most
ingenious
brain.
It
was
well
advertised,
but
it
hardly
needed
it:
the
bold
originality,
the
extraordinary
character,
the
seductive
nature,
and
the
vastness
of
the
enterprise
provoked
comment
everywhere
and
advertised
it
in
every
household
in
the
land.
Who
could
read
the
program
of
the
excursion
without
longing
to
make
one
of
the
party?
I
will
insert
it
here.
It
is
almost
as
good
as
a
map.
As
a
text
for
this
book,
nothing
could
be
better:

EXCURSION
TO
THE
HOLY
LAND,
EGYPT,
THE
CRIMEA,
GREECE,
AND
INTERMEDIATE
POINTS
OF
INTEREST.
BROOKLYN,
February
1st,
1867

The
undersigned
will
make
an
excursion
as
above
during
the
coming
season,
and
begs
to
submit
to
you
the
following
programme:

A
first-class
steamer,
to
be
under
his
own
command,
and
capable
of
accommodating
at
least
one
hundred
and
fifty
cabin
passengers,
will
be
selected,
in
which
will
be
taken
a
select
company,
numbering
not
more
than
three-fourths
of
the
ship's
capacity.
There
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
this
company
can
be
easily
made
up
in
this
immediate
vicinity,
of
mutual
friends
and
acquaintances.

The
steamer
will
be
provided
with
every
necessary
comfort,
including
library
and
musical
instruments.

An
experienced
physician
will
be
on
board.

Leaving
New
York
about
June
1st,
a
middle
and
pleasant
route
will
be
taken
across
the
Atlantic,
and
passing
through
the
group
of
Azores,
St.
Michael
will
be
reached
in
about
ten
days.
A
day
or
two
will
be
spent
here,
enjoying
the
fruit
and
wild
scenery
of
these
islands,
and
the
voyage
continued,
and
Gibraltar
reached
in
three
or
four
days.

A
day
or
two
will
be
spent
here
in
looking
over
the
wonderful
subterraneous
fortifications,
permission
to
visit
these
galleries
being
readily
obtained.

From
Gibraltar,
running
along
the
coasts
of
Spain
and
France,
Marseilles
will
be
reached
in
three
days.
Here
ample
time
will
be
given
not
only
to
look
over
the
city,
which
was
founded
six
hundred
years
before
the
Christian
era,
and
its
artificial
port,
the
finest
of
the
kind
in
the
Mediterranean,
but
to
visit
Paris
during
the
Great
Exhibition;
and
the
beautiful
city
of
Lyons,
lying
intermediate,
from
the
heights
of
which,
on
a
clear
day,
Mont
Blanc
and
the
Alps
can
be
distinctly
seen.
Passengers
who
may
wish
to
extend
the
time
at
Paris
can
do
so,
and,
passing
down
through
Switzerland,
rejoin
the
steamer
at
Genoa.

From
Marseilles
to
Genoa
is
a
run
of
one
night.
The
excursionists
will
have
an
opportunity
to
look
over
this,
the
"magnificent
city
of
palaces,"
and
visit
the
birthplace
of
Columbus,
twelve
miles
off,
over
a
beautiful
road
built
by
Napoleon
I.
From
this
point,
excursions
may
be
made
to
Milan,
Lakes
Como
and
Maggiore,
or
to
Milan,
Verona
(famous
for
its
extraordinary
fortifications),
Padua,
and
Venice.
Or,
if
passengers
desire
to
visit
Parma
(famous
for
Correggio's
frescoes)
and
Bologna,
they
can
by
rail
go
on
to
Florence,
and
rejoin
the
steamer
at
Leghorn,
thus
spending
about
three
weeks
amid
the
cities
most
famous
for
art
in
Italy.

From
Genoa
the
run
to
Leghorn
will
be
made
along
the
coast
in
one
night,
and
time
appropriated
to
this
point
in
which
to
visit
Florence,
its
palaces
and
galleries;
Pisa,
its
cathedral
and
"Leaning
Tower,"
and
Lucca
and
its
baths,
and
Roman
amphitheater;
Florence,
the
most
remote,
being
distant
by
rail
about
sixty
miles.

From
Leghorn
to
Naples
(calling
at
Civita
Vecchia
to
land
any
who
may
prefer
to
go
to
Rome
from
that
point),
the
distance
will
be
made
in
about
thirty-six
hours;
the
route
will
lay
along
the
coast
of
Italy,
close
by
Caprera,
Elba,
and
Corsica.
Arrangements
have
been
made
to
take
on
board
at
Leghorn
a
pilot
for
Caprera,
and,
if
practicable,
a
call
will
be
made
there
to
visit
the
home
of
Garibaldi.

Rome
[by
rail],
Herculaneum,
Pompeii,
Vesuvius,
Vergil's
tomb,
and
possibly
the
ruins
of
Paestum
can
be
visited,
as
well
as
the
beautiful
surroundings
of
Naples
and
its
charming
bay.

The
next
point
of
interest
will
be
Palermo,
the
most
beautiful
city
of
Sicily,
which
will
be
reached
in
one
night
from
Naples.
A
day
will
be
spent
here,
and
leaving
in
the
evening,
the
course
will
be
taken
towards
Athens.

Skirting
along
the
north
coast
of
Sicily,
passing
through
the
group
of
Aeolian
Isles,
in
sight
of
Stromboli
and
Vulcania,
both
active
volcanoes,
through
the
Straits
of
Messina,
with
"Scylla"
on
the
one
hand
and
"Charybdis"
on
the
other,
along
the
east
coast
of
Sicily,
and
in
sight
of
Mount
Etna,
along
the
south
coast
of
Italy,
the
west
and
south
coast
of
Greece,
in
sight
of
ancient
Crete,
up
Athens
Gulf,
and
into
the
Piraeus,
Athens
will
be
reached
in
two
and
a
half
or
three
days.
After
tarrying
here
awhile,
the
Bay
of
Salamis
will
be
crossed,
and
a
day
given
to
Corinth,
whence
the
voyage
will
be
continued
to
Constantinople,
passing
on
the
way
through
the
Grecian
Archipelago,
the
Dardanelles,
the
Sea
of
Marmora,
and
the
mouth
of
the
Golden
Horn,
and
arriving
in
about
forty-eight
hours
from
Athens.

After
leaving
Constantinople,
the
way
will
be
taken
out
through
the
beautiful
Bosphorus,
across
the
Black
Sea
to
Sebastopol
and
Balaklava,
a
run
of
about
twenty-four
hours.
Here
it
is
proposed
to
remain
two
days,
visiting
the
harbors,
fortifications,
and
battlefields
of
the
Crimea;
thence
back
through
the
Bosphorus,
touching
at
Constantinople
to
take
in
any
who
may
have
preferred
to
remain
there;
down
through
the
Sea
of
Marmora
and
the
Dardanelles,
along
the
coasts
of
ancient
Troy
and
Lydia
in
Asia,
to
Smyrna,
which
will
be
reached
in
two
or
two
and
a
half
days
from
Constantinople.
A
sufficient
stay
will
be
made
here
to
give
opportunity
of
visiting
Ephesus,
fifty
miles
distant
by
rail.

From
Smyrna
towards
the
Holy
Land
the
course
will
lay
through
the
Grecian
Archipelago,
close
by
the
Isle
of
Patmos,
along
the
coast
of
Asia,
ancient
Pamphylia,
and
the
Isle
of
Cyprus.
Beirut
will
be
reached
in
three
days.
At
Beirut
time
will
be
given
to
visit
Damascus;
after
which
the
steamer
will
proceed
to
Joppa.

From
Joppa,
Jerusalem,
the
River
Jordan,
the
Sea
of
Tiberias,
Nazareth,
Bethany,
Bethlehem,
and
other
points
of
interest
in
the
Holy
Land
can
be
visited,
and
here
those
who
may
have
preferred
to
make
the
journey
from
Beirut
through
the
country,
passing
through
Damascus,
Galilee,
Capernaum,
Samaria,
and
by
the
River
Jordan
and
Sea
of
Tiberias,
can
rejoin
the
steamer.

Leaving
Joppa,
the
next
point
of
interest
to
visit
will
be
Alexandria,
which
will
be
reached
in
twenty-four
hours.
The
ruins
of
Caesar's
Palace,
Pompey's
Pillar,
Cleopatra's
Needle,
the
Catacombs,
and
ruins
of
ancient
Alexandria
will
be
found
worth
the
visit.
The
journey
to
Cairo,
one
hundred
and
thirty
miles
by
rail,
can
be
made
in
a
few
hours,
and
from
which
can
be
visited
the
site
of
ancient
Memphis,
Joseph's
Granaries,
and
the
Pyramids.

From
Alexandria
the
route
will
be
taken
homeward,
calling
at
Malta,
Cagliari
(in
Sardinia),
and
Palma
(in
Majorca),
all
magnificent
harbors,
with
charming
scenery,
and
abounding
in
fruits.

A
day
or
two
will
be
spent
at
each
place,
and
leaving
Parma
in
the
evening,
Valencia
in
Spain
will
be
reached
the
next
morning.
A
few
days
will
be
spent
in
this,
the
finest
city
of
Spain.

From
Valencia,
the
homeward
course
will
be
continued,
skirting
along
the
coast
of
Spain.
Alicant,
Carthagena,
Palos,
and
Malaga
will
be
passed
but
a
mile
or
two
distant,
and
Gibraltar
reached
in
about
twenty-four
hours.

A
stay
of
one
day
will
be
made
here,
and
the
voyage
continued
to
Madeira,
which
will
be
reached
in
about
three
days.
Captain
Marryatt
writes:
"I
do
not
know
a
spot
on
the
globe
which
so
much
astonishes
and
delights
upon
first
arrival
as
Madeira."
A
stay
of
one
or
two
days
will
be
made
here,
which,
if
time
permits,
may
be
extended,
and
passing
on
through
the
islands,
and
probably
in
sight
of
the
Peak
of
Teneriffe,
a
southern
track
will
be
taken,
and
the
Atlantic
crossed
within
the
latitudes
of
the
northeast
trade
winds,
where
mild
and
pleasant
weather,
and
a
smooth
sea,
can
always
be
expected.

A
call
will
be
made
at
Bermuda,
which
lies
directly
in
this
route
homeward,
and
will
be
reached
in
about
ten
days
from
Madeira,
and
after
spending
a
short
time
with
our
friends
the
Bermudians,
the
final
departure
will
be
made
for
home,
which
will
be
reached
in
about
three
days.

Already,
applications
have
been
received
from
parties
in
Europe
wishing
to
join
the
Excursion
there.

The
ship
will
at
all
times
be
a
home,
where
the
excursionists,
if
sick,
will
be
surrounded
by
kind
friends,
and
have
all
possible
comfort
and
sympathy.

Should
contagious
sickness
exist
in
any
of
the
ports
named
in
the
program,
such
ports
will
be
passed,
and
others
of
interest
substituted.

The
price
of
passage
is
fixed
at
$1,250,
currency,
for
each
adult
passenger.
Choice
of
rooms
and
of
seats
at
the
tables
apportioned
in
the
order
in
which
passages
are
engaged;
and
no
passage
considered
engaged
until
ten
percent
of
the
passage
money
is
deposited
with
the
treasurer.

Passengers
can
remain
on
board
of
the
steamer,
at
all
ports,
if
they
desire,
without
additional
expense,
and
all
boating
at
the
expense
of
the
ship.

All
passages
must
be
paid
for
when
taken,
in
order
that
the
most
perfect
arrangements
be
made
for
starting
at
the
appointed
time.

Applications
for
passage
must
be
approved
by
the
committee
before
tickets
are
issued,
and
can
be
made
to
the
undersigned.

Articles
of
interest
or
curiosity,
procured
by
the
passengers
during
the
voyage,
may
be
brought
home
in
the
steamer
free
of
charge.

Five
dollars
per
day,
in
gold,
it
is
believed,
will
be
a
fair
calculation
to
make
for
all
traveling
expenses
onshore
and
at
the
various
points
where
passengers
may
wish
to
leave
the
steamer
for
days
at
a
time.

The
trip
can
be
extended,
and
the
route
changed,
by
unanimous
vote
of
the
passengers.

P.S.--The
very
beautiful
and
substantial
side-wheel
steamship
"Quaker
City"
has
been
chartered
for
the
occasion,
and
will
leave
New
York
June
8th.
Letters
have
been
issued
by
the
government
commending
the
party
to
courtesies
abroad.

What
was
there
lacking
about
that
program
to
make
it
perfectly
irresistible?
Nothing
that
any
finite
mind
could
discover.
Paris,
England,
Scotland,
Switzerland,
Italy--Garibaldi!
The
Grecian
Archipelago!
Vesuvius!
Constantinople!
Smyrna!
The
Holy
Land!
Egypt
and
"our
friends
the
Bermudians"!
People
in
Europe
desiring
to
join
the
excursion--contagious
sickness
to
be
avoided--boating
at
the
expense
of
the
ship--physician
on
board--the
circuit
of
the
globe
to
be
made
if
the
passengers
unanimously
desired
it--the
company
to
be
rigidly
selected
by
a
pitiless
"Committee
on
Applications"--the
vessel
to
be
as
rigidly
selected
by
as
pitiless
a
"Committee
on
Selecting
Steamer."
Human
nature
could
not
withstand
these
bewildering
temptations.
I
hurried
to
the
treasurer's
office
and
deposited
my
ten
percent.
I
rejoiced
to
know
that
a
few
vacant
staterooms
were
still
left.
I
did
avoid
a
critical
personal
examination
into
my
character
by
that
bowelless
committee,
but
I
referred
to
all
the
people
of
high
standing
I
could
think
of
in
the
community
who
would
be
least
likely
to
know
anything
about
me.

Shortly
a
supplementary
program
was
issued
which
set
forth
that
the
Plymouth
Collection
of
Hymns
would
be
used
on
board
the
ship.
I
then
paid
the
balance
of
my
passage
money.

I
was
provided
with
a
receipt
and
duly
and
officially
accepted
as
an
excursionist.
There
was
happiness
in
that
but
it
was
tame
compared
to
the
novelty
of
being
"select."

This
supplementary
program
also
instructed
the
excursionists
to
provide
themselves
with
light
musical
instruments
for
amusement
in
the
ship,
with
saddles
for
Syrian
travel,
green
spectacles
and
umbrellas,
veils
for
Egypt,
and
substantial
clothing
to
use
in
rough
pilgrimizing
in
the
Holy
Land.
Furthermore,
it
was
suggested
that
although
the
ship's
library
would
afford
a
fair
amount
of
reading
matter,
it
would
still
be
well
if
each
passenger
would
provide
himself
with
a
few
guidebooks,
a
Bible,
and
some
standard
works
of
travel.
A
list
was
appended,
which
consisted
chiefly
of
books
relating
to
the
Holy
Land,
since
the
Holy
Land
was
part
of
the
excursion
and
seemed
to
be
its
main
feature.

Reverend
Henry
Ward
Beecher
was
to
have
accompanied
the
expedition,
but
urgent
duties
obliged
him
to
give
up
the
idea.
There
were
other
passengers
who
could
have
been
spared
better
and
would
have
been
spared
more
willingly.
Lieutenant
General
Sherman
was
to
have
been
of
the
party
also,
but
the
Indian
war
compelled
his
presence
on
the
plains.
A
popular
actress
had
entered
her
name
on
the
ship's
books,
but
something
interfered
and
she
couldn't
go.
The
"Drummer
Boy
of
the
Potomac"
deserted,
and
lo,
we
had
never
a
celebrity
left!

However,
we
were
to
have
a
"battery
of
guns"
from
the
Navy
Department
(as
per
advertisement)
to
be
used
in
answering
royal
salutes;
and
the
document
furnished
by
the
Secretary
of
the
Navy,
which
was
to
make
"General
Sherman
and
party"
welcome
guests
in
the
courts
and
camps
of
the
old
world,
was
still
left
to
us,
though
both
document
and
battery,
I
think,
were
shorn
of
somewhat
of
their
original
august
proportions.
However,
had
not
we
the
seductive
program
still,
with
its
Paris,
its
Constantinople,
Smyrna,
Jerusalem,
Jericho,
and
"our
friends
the
Bermudians?"
What
did
we
care?




CHAPTER
II.

Occasionally,
during
the
following
month,
I
dropped
in
at
117
Wall
Street
to
inquire
how
the
repairing
and
refurnishing
of
the
vessel
was
coming
on,
how
additions
to
the
passenger
list
were
averaging,
how
many
people
the
committee
were
decreeing
not
"select"
every
day
and
banishing
in
sorrow
and
tribulation.
I
was
glad
to
know
that
we
were
to
have
a
little
printing
press
on
board
and
issue
a
daily
newspaper
of
our
own.
I
was
glad
to
learn
that
our
piano,
our
parlor
organ,
and
our
melodeon
were
to
be
the
best
instruments
of
the
kind
that
could
be
had
in
the
market.
I
was
proud
to
observe
that
among
our
excursionists
were
three
ministers
of
the
gospel,
eight
doctors,
sixteen
or
eighteen
ladies,
several
military
and
naval
chieftains
with
sounding
titles,
an
ample
crop
of
"Professors"
of
various
kinds,
and
a
gentleman
who
had
"COMMISSIONER
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
OF
AMERICA
TO
EUROPE,
ASIA,
AND
AFRICA"
thundering
after
his
name
in
one
awful
blast!
I
had
carefully
prepared
myself
to
take
rather
a
back
seat
in
that
ship
because
of
the
uncommonly
select
material
that
would
alone
be
permitted
to
pass
through
the
camel's
eye
of
that
committee
on
credentials;
I
had
schooled
myself
to
expect
an
imposing
array
of
military
and
naval
heroes
and
to
have
to
set
that
back
seat
still
further
back
in
consequence
of
it
maybe;
but
I
state
frankly
that
I
was
all
unprepared
for
this
crusher.

I
fell
under
that
titular
avalanche
a
torn
and
blighted
thing.
I
said
that
if
that
potentate
must
go
over
in
our
ship,
why,
I
supposed
he
must
--but
that
to
my
thinking,
when
the
United
States
considered
it
necessary
to
send
a
dignitary
of
that
tonnage
across
the
ocean,
it
would
be
in
better
taste,
and
safer,
to
take
him
apart
and
cart
him
over
in
sections
in
several
ships.

Ah,
if
I
had
only
known
then
that
he
was
only
a
common
mortal,
and
that
his
mission
had
nothing
more
overpowering
about
it
than
the
collecting
of
seeds
and
uncommon
yams
and
extraordinary
cabbages
and
peculiar
bullfrogs
for
that
poor,
useless,
innocent,
mildewed
old
fossil
the
Smithsonian
Institute,
I
would
have
felt
so
much
relieved.

During
that
memorable
month
I
basked
in
the
happiness
of
being
for
once
in
my
life
drifting
with
the
tide
of
a
great
popular
movement.
Everybody
was
going
to
Europe--I,
too,
was
going
to
Europe.
Everybody
was
going
to
the
famous
Paris
Exposition--I,
too,
was
going
to
the
Paris
Exposition.
The
steamship
lines
were
carrying
Americans
out
of
the
various
ports
of
the
country
at
the
rate
of
four
or
five
thousand
a
week
in
the
aggregate.
If
I
met
a
dozen
individuals
during
that
month
who
were
not
going
to
Europe
shortly,
I
have
no
distinct
remembrance
of
it
now.
I
walked
about
the
city
a
good
deal
with
a
young
Mr.
Blucher,
who
was
booked
for
the
excursion.
He
was
confiding,
good-natured,
unsophisticated,
companionable;
but
he
was
not
a
man
to
set
the
river
on
fire.
He
had
the
most
extraordinary
notions
about
this
European
exodus
and
came
at
last
to
consider
the
whole
nation
as
packing
up
for
emigration
to
France.
We
stepped
into
a
store
on
Broadway
one
day,
where
he
bought
a
handkerchief,
and
when
the
man
could
not
make
change,
Mr.
B.
said:

"Never
mind,
I'll
hand
it
to
you
in
Paris."

"But
I
am
not
going
to
Paris."

"How
is--what
did
I
understand
you
to
say?"

"I
said
I
am
not
going
to
Paris."

"Not
going
to
Paris!
Not
g----
well,
then,
where
in
the
nation
are
you
going
to?"

"Nowhere
at
all."

"Not
anywhere
whatsoever?--not
any
place
on
earth
but
this?"

"Not
any
place
at
all
but
just
this--stay
here
all
summer."

My
comrade
took
his
purchase
and
walked
out
of
the
store
without
a
word
--walked
out
with
an
injured
look
upon
his
countenance.
Up
the
street
apiece
he
broke
silence
and
said
impressively:
"It
was
a
lie--that
is
my
opinion
of
it!"

In
the
fullness
of
time
the
ship
was
ready
to
receive
her
passengers.
I
was
introduced
to
the
young
gentleman
who
was
to
be
my
roommate,
and
found
him
to
be
intelligent,
cheerful
of
spirit,
unselfish,
full
of
generous
impulses,
patient,
considerate,
and
wonderfully
good-natured.
Not
any
passenger
that
sailed
in
the
Quaker
City
will
withhold
his
endorsement
of
what
I
have
just
said.
We
selected
a
stateroom
forward
of
the
wheel,
on
the
starboard
side,
"below
decks."
It
had
two
berths
in
it,
a
dismal
dead-light,
a
sink
with
a
washbowl
in
it,
and
a
long,
sumptuously
cushioned
locker,
which
was
to
do
service
as
a
sofa--partly--and
partly
as
a
hiding
place
for
our
things.
Notwithstanding
all
this
furniture,
there
was
still
room
to
turn
around
in,
but
not
to
swing
a
cat
in,
at
least
with
entire
security
to
the
cat.
However,
the
room
was
large,
for
a
ship's
stateroom,
and
was
in
every
way
satisfactory.

The
vessel
was
appointed
to
sail
on
a
certain
Saturday
early
in
June.

A
little
after
noon
on
that
distinguished
Saturday
I
reached
the
ship
and
went
on
board.
All
was
bustle
and
confusion.
[I
have
seen
that
remark
before
somewhere.]
The
pier
was
crowded
with
carriages
and
men;
passengers
were
arriving
and
hurrying
on
board;
the
vessel's
decks
were
encumbered
with
trunks
and
valises;
groups
of
excursionists,
arrayed
in
unattractive
traveling
costumes,
were
moping
about
in
a
drizzling
rain
and
looking
as
droopy
and
woebegone
as
so
many
molting
chickens.
The
gallant
flag
was
up,
but
it
was
under
the
spell,
too,
and
hung
limp
and
disheartened
by
the
mast.
Altogether,
it
was
the
bluest,
bluest
spectacle!
It
was
a
pleasure
excursion--there
was
no
gainsaying
that,
because
the
program
said
so--it
was
so
nominated
in
the
bond--but
it
surely
hadn't
the
general
aspect
of
one.

Finally,
above
the
banging,
and
rumbling,
and
shouting,
and
hissing
of
steam
rang
the
order
to
"cast
off!"--a
sudden
rush
to
the
gangways--a
scampering
ashore
of
visitors-a
revolution
of
the
wheels,
and
we
were
off--the
pic-nic
was
begun!
Two
very
mild
cheers
went
up
from
the
dripping
crowd
on
the
pier;
we
answered
them
gently
from
the
slippery
decks;
the
flag
made
an
effort
to
wave,
and
failed;
the
"battery
of
guns"
spake
not--the
ammunition
was
out.

We
steamed
down
to
the
foot
of
the
harbor
and
came
to
anchor.
It
was
still
raining.
And
not
only
raining,
but
storming.
"Outside"
we
could
see,
ourselves,
that
there
was
a
tremendous
sea
on.
We
must
lie
still,
in
the
calm
harbor,
till
the
storm
should
abate.
Our
passengers
hailed
from
fifteen
states;
only
a
few
of
them
had
ever
been
to
sea
before;
manifestly
it
would
not
do
to
pit
them
against
a
full-blown
tempest
until
they
had
got
their
sea-legs
on.
Toward
evening
the
two
steam
tugs
that
had
accompanied
us
with
a
rollicking
champagne-party
of
young
New
Yorkers
on
board
who
wished
to
bid
farewell
to
one
of
our
number
in
due
and
ancient
form
departed,
and
we
were
alone
on
the
deep.
On
deep
five
fathoms,
and
anchored
fast
to
the
bottom.
And
out
in
the
solemn
rain,
at
that.
This
was
pleasuring
with
a
vengeance.

It
was
an
appropriate
relief
when
the
gong
sounded
for
prayer
meeting.
The
first
Saturday
night
of
any
other
pleasure
excursion
might
have
been
devoted
to
whist
and
dancing;
but
I
submit
it
to
the
unprejudiced
mind
if
it
would
have
been
in
good
taste
for
us
to
engage
in
such
frivolities,
considering
what
we
had
gone
through
and
the
frame
of
mind
we
were
in.
We
would
have
shone
at
a
wake,
but
not
at
anything
more
festive.

However,
there
is
always
a
cheering
influence
about
the
sea;
and
in
my
berth
that
night,
rocked
by
the
measured
swell
of
the
waves
and
lulled
by
the
murmur
of
the
distant
surf,
I
soon
passed
tranquilly
out
of
all
consciousness
of
the
dreary
experiences
of
the
day
and
damaging
premonitions
of
the
future.




CHAPTER
III.

All
day
Sunday
at
anchor.
The
storm
had
gone
down
a
great
deal,
but
the
sea
had
not.
It
was
still
piling
its
frothy
hills
high
in
air
"outside,"
as
we
could
plainly
see
with
the
glasses.
We
could
not
properly
begin
a
pleasure
excursion
on
Sunday;
we
could
not
offer
untried
stomachs
to
so
pitiless
a
sea
as
that.
We
must
lie
still
till
Monday.
And
we
did.
But
we
had
repetitions
of
church
and
prayer-meetings;
and
so,
of
course,
we
were
just
as
eligibly
situated
as
we
could
have
been
any
where.

I
was
up
early
that
Sabbath
morning
and
was
early
to
breakfast.
I
felt
a
perfectly
natural
desire
to
have
a
good,
long,
unprejudiced
look
at
the
passengers
at
a
time
when
they
should
be
free
from
self-consciousness
--which
is
at
breakfast,
when
such
a
moment
occurs
in
the
lives
of
human
beings
at
all.

I
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
so
many
elderly
people--I
might
almost
say,
so
many
venerable
people.
A
glance
at
the
long
lines
of
heads
was
apt
to
make
one
think
it
was
all
gray.
But
it
was
not.
There
was
a
tolerably
fair
sprinkling
of
young
folks,
and
another
fair
sprinkling
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
who
were
non-committal
as
to
age,
being
neither
actually
old
or
absolutely
young.

The
next
morning
we
weighed
anchor
and
went
to
sea.
It
was
a
great
happiness
to
get
away
after
this
dragging,
dispiriting
delay.
I
thought
there
never
was
such
gladness
in
the
air
before,
such
brightness
in
the
sun,
such
beauty
in
the
sea.
I
was
satisfied
with
the
picnic
then
and
with
all
its
belongings.
All
my
malicious
instincts
were
dead
within
me;
and
as
America
faded
out
of
sight,
I
think
a
spirit
of
charity
rose
up
in
their
place
that
was
as
boundless,
for
the
time
being,
as
the
broad
ocean
that
was
heaving
its
billows
about
us.
I
wished
to
express
my
feelings
--I
wished
to
lift
up
my
voice
and
sing;
but
I
did
not
know
anything
to
sing,
and
so
I
was
obliged
to
give
up
the
idea.
It
was
no
loss
to
the
ship,
though,
perhaps.

It
was
breezy
and
pleasant,
but
the
sea
was
still
very
rough.
One
could
not
promenade
without
risking
his
neck;
at
one
moment
the
bowsprit
was
taking
a
deadly
aim
at
the
sun
in
midheaven,
and
at
the
next
it
was
trying
to
harpoon
a
shark
in
the
bottom
of
the
ocean.
What
a
weird
sensation
it
is
to
feel
the
stern
of
a
ship
sinking
swiftly
from
under
you
and
see
the
bow
climbing
high
away
among
the
clouds!
One's
safest
course
that
day
was
to
clasp
a
railing
and
hang
on;
walking
was
too
precarious
a
pastime.

By
some
happy
fortune
I
was
not
seasick.--That
was
a
thing
to
be
proud
of.
I
had
not
always
escaped
before.
If
there
is
one
thing
in
the
world
that
will
make
a
man
peculiarly
and
insufferably
self-conceited,
it
is
to
have
his
stomach
behave
itself,
the
first
day
at
sea,
when
nearly
all
his
comrades
are
seasick.
Soon
a
venerable
fossil,
shawled
to
the
chin
and
bandaged
like
a
mummy,
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
after
deck-house,
and
the
next
lurch
of
the
ship
shot
him
into
my
arms.
I
said:

"Good-morning,
Sir.
It
is
a
fine
day."

He
put
his
hand
on
his
stomach
and
said,
"Oh,
my!"
and
then
staggered
away
and
fell
over
the
coop
of
a
skylight.

Presently
another
old
gentleman
was
projected
from
the
same
door
with
great
violence.
I
said:

"Calm
yourself,
Sir--There
is
no
hurry.
It
is
a
fine
day,
Sir."

He,
also,
put
his
hand
on
his
stomach
and
said
"Oh,
my!"
and
reeled
away.

In
a
little
while
another
veteran
was
discharged
abruptly
from
the
same
door,
clawing
at
the
air
for
a
saving
support.
I
said:

"Good
morning,
Sir.
It
is
a
fine
day
for
pleasuring.
You
were
about
to
say--"

"Oh,
my!"

I
thought
so.
I
anticipated
him,
anyhow.
I
stayed
there
and
was
bombarded
with
old
gentlemen
for
an
hour,
perhaps;
and
all
I
got
out
of
any
of
them
was
"Oh,
my!"

I
went
away
then
in
a
thoughtful
mood.
I
said,
this
is
a
good
pleasure
excursion.
I
like
it.
The
passengers
are
not
garrulous,
but
still
they
are
sociable.
I
like
those
old
people,
but
somehow
they
all
seem
to
have
the
"Oh,
my"
rather
bad.

I
knew
what
was
the
matter
with
them.
They
were
seasick.
And
I
was
glad
of
it.
We
all
like
to
see
people
seasick
when
we
are
not,
ourselves.
Playing
whist
by
the
cabin
lamps
when
it
is
storming
outside
is
pleasant;
walking
the
quarterdeck
in
the
moonlight
is
pleasant;
smoking
in
the
breezy
foretop
is
pleasant
when
one
is
not
afraid
to
go
up
there;
but
these
are
all
feeble
and
commonplace
compared
with
the
joy
of
seeing
people
suffering
the
miseries
of
seasickness.

I
picked
up
a
good
deal
of
information
during
the
afternoon.
At
one
time
I
was
climbing
up
the
quarterdeck
when
the
vessel's
stem
was
in
the
sky;
I
was
smoking
a
cigar
and
feeling
passably
comfortable.
Somebody
ejaculated:

"Come,
now,
that
won't
answer.
Read
the
sign
up
there--NO
SMOKING
ABAFT
THE
WHEEL!"

It
was
Captain
Duncan,
chief
of
the
expedition.
I
went
forward,
of
course.
I
saw
a
long
spyglass
lying
on
a
desk
in
one
of
the
upper-deck
state-rooms
back
of
the
pilot-house
and
reached
after
it--there
was
a
ship
in
the
distance.

"Ah,
ah--hands
off!
Come
out
of
that!"

I
came
out
of
that.
I
said
to
a
deck-sweep--but
in
a
low
voice:

"Who
is
that
overgrown
pirate
with
the
whiskers
and
the
discordant
voice?"

"It's
Captain
Bursley--executive
officer--sailing
master."

I
loitered
about
awhile,
and
then,
for
want
of
something
better
to
do,
fell
to
carving
a
railing
with
my
knife.
Somebody
said,
in
an
insinuating,
admonitory
voice:

"Now,
say--my
friend--don't
you
know
any
better
than
to
be
whittling
the
ship
all
to
pieces
that
way?
You
ought
to
know
better
than
that."

I
went
back
and
found
the
deck
sweep.

"Who
is
that
smooth-faced,
animated
outrage
yonder
in
the
fine
clothes?"

"That's
Captain
L****,
the
owner
of
the
ship--he's
one
of
the
main
bosses."

In
the
course
of
time
I
brought
up
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
pilot-house
and
found
a
sextant
lying
on
a
bench.
Now,
I
said,
they
"take
the
sun"
through
this
thing;
I
should
think
I
might
see
that
vessel
through
it.
I
had
hardly
got
it
to
my
eye
when
someone
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
and
said
deprecatingly:

"I'll
have
to
get
you
to
give
that
to
me,
Sir.
If
there's
anything
you'd
like
to
know
about
taking
the
sun,
I'd
as
soon
tell
you
as
not--but
I
don't
like
to
trust
anybody
with
that
instrument.
If
you
want
any
figuring
done--Aye,
aye,
sir!"

He
was
gone
to
answer
a
call
from
the
other
side.
I
sought
the
deck-sweep.

"Who
is
that
spider-legged
gorilla
yonder
with
the
sanctimonious
countenance?"

"It's
Captain
Jones,
sir--the
chief
mate."

"Well.
This
goes
clear
away
ahead
of
anything
I
ever
heard
of
before.
Do
you--now
I
ask
you
as
a
man
and
a
brother--do
you
think
I
could
venture
to
throw
a
rock
here
in
any
given
direction
without
hitting
a
captain
of
this
ship?"

"Well,
sir,
I
don't
know--I
think
likely
you'd
fetch
the
captain
of
the
watch
may
be,
because
he's
a-standing
right
yonder
in
the
way."

I
went
below--meditating
and
a
little
downhearted.
I
thought,
if
five
cooks
can
spoil
a
broth,
what
may
not
five
captains
do
with
a
pleasure
excursion.




CHAPTER
IV.

We
plowed
along
bravely
for
a
week
or
more,
and
without
any
conflict
of
jurisdiction
among
the
captains
worth
mentioning.
The
passengers
soon
learned
to
accommodate
themselves
to
their
new
circumstances,
and
life
in
the
ship
became
nearly
as
systematically
monotonous
as
the
routine
of
a
barrack.
I
do
not
mean
that
it
was
dull,
for
it
was
not
entirely
so
by
any
means--but
there
was
a
good
deal
of
sameness
about
it.
As
is
always
the
fashion
at
sea,
the
passengers
shortly
began
to
pick
up
sailor
terms
--a
sign
that
they
were
beginning
to
feel
at
home.
Half-past
six
was
no
longer
half-past
six
to
these
pilgrims
from
New
England,
the
South,
and
the
Mississippi
Valley,
it
was
"seven
bells";
eight,
twelve,
and
four
o'clock
were
"eight
bells";
the
captain
did
not
take
the
longitude
at
nine
o'clock,
but
at
"two
bells."
They
spoke
glibly
of
the
"after
cabin,"
the
"for'rard
cabin,"
"port
and
starboard"
and
the
"fo'castle."

At
seven
bells
the
first
gong
rang;
at
eight
there
was
breakfast,
for
such
as
were
not
too
seasick
to
eat
it.
After
that
all
the
well
people
walked
arm-in-arm
up
and
down
the
long
promenade
deck,
enjoying
the
fine
summer
mornings,
and
the
seasick
ones
crawled
out
and
propped
themselves
up
in
the
lee
of
the
paddle-boxes
and
ate
their
dismal
tea
and
toast,
and
looked
wretched.
From
eleven
o'clock
until
luncheon,
and
from
luncheon
until
dinner
at
six
in
the
evening,
the
employments
and
amusements
were
various.
Some
reading
was
done,
and
much
smoking
and
sewing,
though
not
by
the
same
parties;
there
were
the
monsters
of
the
deep
to
be
looked
after
and
wondered
at;
strange
ships
had
to
be
scrutinized
through
opera-glasses,
and
sage
decisions
arrived
at
concerning
them;
and
more
than
that,
everybody
took
a
personal
interest
in
seeing
that
the
flag
was
run
up
and
politely
dipped
three
times
in
response
to
the
salutes
of
those
strangers;
in
the
smoking
room
there
were
always
parties
of
gentlemen
playing
euchre,
draughts
and
dominoes,
especially
dominoes,
that
delightfully
harmless
game;
and
down
on
the
main
deck,
"for'rard"
--for'rard
of
the
chicken-coops
and
the
cattle--we
had
what
was
called
"horse
billiards."
Horse
billiards
is
a
fine
game.
It
affords
good,
active
exercise,
hilarity,
and
consuming
excitement.
It
is
a
mixture
of
"hop-scotch"
and
shuffleboard
played
with
a
crutch.
A
large
hop-scotch
diagram
is
marked
out
on
the
deck
with
chalk,
and
each
compartment
numbered.
You
stand
off
three
or
four
steps,
with
some
broad
wooden
disks
before
you
on
the
deck,
and
these
you
send
forward
with
a
vigorous
thrust
of
a
long
crutch.
If
a
disk
stops
on
a
chalk
line,
it
does
not
count
anything.
If
it
stops
in
division
No.
7,
it
counts
7;
in
5,
it
counts
5,
and
so
on.
The
game
is
100,
and
four
can
play
at
a
time.
That
game
