# Keep in Mind

Q: how to build a software/system from scratch?

A: make it work then make it perfect. aka, practice makes perfect.

# Goals in BETA version

* seperate modules & add necessary modules

* glue together first

* from standalone to cluster

* abstraction and reconstraction in the loop

# Ways to get there

## Clean Code

* Bad Code: the only valid measurement of code quality: WTFs/minute

* I can teach you the physics of riding a bicycle, prove to you that bicycle riding is practical, and you'd still fall down the first time you cliembed on that bike. Coding is no different.
